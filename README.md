Nav-Bar

The SVG item I created and exported in xd for the logo is not able to change the colour. Not sure what the issue is.

Search input in the nav-bar.
This caused me a few issues. Much more then I expected. Mianly around aligning the items within the nav-ber flex box.

One thing that slowed me up a little was being able to target the indevidual elements.

with aligning the items I had issue with placeing the search bar correctly, adding the icon next to the search bar, and in particular aligning the icon inside the middle of the box. As the SVG is though of as a text item I used the text-align property, ufortunatly this just aligned the icon on the horizontal axis, I tried various propeties to work around jusitfy-content ann others. Eventually I made a div around the item and made that div a flex-box and then centered the content inside.

Finishing off the search bar with a border on focus and then and making clicking on the area around the icon also make the bar focused rasied some more issues with aligning the content. I have worked around it by adding another div element and then adding a top margin to get them aligned. I do not feel like this is the most efficiate way to do this.
